- Here's how the app works:

- Only two users can play at the same time.

- Players need to register before they can begin playing

- Both players can pick either rock, paper or scissors. After both players make their selection, the game tells them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

- The game tracks each player's wins and losses.

- Chat functionality is enabled.
